# Predicting Building Energy Efficiency

## About the Project
This project analyzes the Energy Efficiency dataset to predict heating load (Y1) based on building architectural features (X1–X8).  
We apply Linear Regression, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and Ridge Regression to evaluate model performance and stability.

## Techniques Used
- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Linear Regression Modeling
- PCA for Feature Reduction
- Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)

## Tools
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Seaborn

## Results
- Achieved R² of 0.91 using original features.
- Slight drop to R² of 0.85 after PCA reduction.
- Ridge Regression improved model robustness.

## Dataset
Energy Efficiency Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
